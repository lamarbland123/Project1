<h1>My Journey</h1>

<h2>January 23rd 1980</h2>

    <article>"I was born in Washington, D.C. and raised in Prince George's County, MD.  As a child, I was extremely creative and had a fierce competitive streak.  So it was no surprise that I gravitated to both the arts and athletics.  Even back then, I was always seeking new challenges and avenues of self-expression. I graduated from high school in 1998 and attended Morgan State University in Baltimore, MD, my dad's alma mater.  There, I was a Journalism major after a very brief stint in Computer Science.  Needless to say, this was a period where I was struggling to find myself; but it's also poetic in the sense that my career focus has now come full circle."</article>

<h2>January 25th 2002</h2>

    <article>"On this day, my first of three children was born only two days after my 22nd birthday.  I guess you can say that we've watched each other grow up over the years.  But I wasn't done there.  I would later have my second and third children in the years to come.  Being a parent is a huge part of who I am, and it's by far the most rewarding title I've ever carried. It also helps when you're raising extraordinary human beings, even though you sometimes have to share the credit (lol)."</article>

<h2>July 2013</h2>

    <article>"After working as a federal law enforcement officer for about seven years, I wanted to take my talents to the office, while remaining in the public sector.  In 2013, I landed a job as a paralegal for The Department of Justice.  I was tasked with being on the payment processing side of a Congress-led program called The 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund.  The objective of the VCF was to reward compensation to victims and first responders, to include their families, who were injured or lost due to the events of 9/11.  I took great pride in this unique role as I dealt regularly with those affected, as well as their legal representatives.  Hearing the stories every day about the lives of these individuals was both heartbreaking and inspiring.  But this wouldn't be the last time I would be asked to put service before self."</article>

<h2>October 2014</h2>

    <img src="Young_airman.jpg" alt="Young Airman Photo" style="width: 20%"/>

    <article>"After being sworn to service in February, I successfully completed Basic Military Training for The U.S. Air Force on October 31, 2014.  And I did so by being an outstanding performer both inside and outside the classroom.  As a member of the 113th Maintenance Squadron for The DC Air National Guard, I quickly excelled in my career as an Aircraft Hydraulics Technician.  In fact, as a result of my accelerated understanding, I was offered a full-time AGR/Active Guard Reserve position and became a section chief by my third year.  DUring my time with the DC ANG, I was part of many theater support packages and deployments, some of which included: Guam, South Korea, Poland, Japan, Philippines, Alaska, Germany, and Saudi Arabia.  The latter was my first combat environment during rising tensions in the Middle East as citizens evacuated Afghanistan."</article>

<h2>June 2021-Present</h2>   

    <img src="Mil_Collage.JPG" alt="Military Collage" style="width: 20%"/>
    <article>"In June of 2021, my family and I decided to relocate to Atlanta, GA, and we closed on our first home.  For the first time in my life, I learned what it was like to be a 'traveling spouse'.  But the move presented an intriguing opportunity to switch career fields in the Air Force after transferring units.  This was the break I needed to leave Aircraft Maintenance and forge a path into Tech.  Once my testing scores were approved, I was offered a position as a Cyber Transport Specialist (1D7XX) with the 165th Joint Communications Support Squadron in Brunswick, GA.  This position was of great importance to me because it grants members a Top-Secret clearance and various certifications in the IT sphere.  While awaiting school dates, I decided to apply for the VET TEC program (offered by SkillStorm), to learn basic competencies about software development and get my feet wet.  It has proven to be most helpful in my journey thus far."</article>
